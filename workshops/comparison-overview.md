# Overview of DDI ways of comparing items

## Grouping

### Variable and Question Groups
Use of These specialised structures allow a list of references to items which can be grouped normally to a controlled vocabulary
Variable Groups example: https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/Item/uk.closer/766a9222-4c66-4f84-9259-b78ceda9ceab/1
```mermaid
graph LR
  VGr[Age] --> Day[Date on Individual Questionnaire-day]
  VGr[Age] --> Month[Date on Individual Questionnaire-month]
  VGr[Age] --> Year[Date on Individual Questionnaire-year]
```

### BasedOn
This allows an item to reference another item using the source URN and also supports both a textual description and use of  a controlled vocabulary.

#### Single source
```mermaid
graph RL
WellC[Wellness Questions-CAPI]  -- BasedOn --> WellP[Wellness Questions-Paper]
WellT[Wellness Questions-Telephone] -- BasedOn --> WellP[Wellness Questions-Paper]
WellW[Wellness Questions-Web] -- BasedOn --> WellP[Wellness Questions-Paper]
```
#### Lifecycle evolution of a question and variable
```mermaid
graph TB
  Pol90[Which Party did you vote for in the 1990 General Election] -- BasedOn -->  Pol80[Which Party did you vote for in the 1980 General Election]
  subgraph 1990
    Pol90[Which Party did you vote for in the 1990 General Election] --> Pol90Var[Party voted for in 1990]
  end  subgraph 1980
    Pol80[Which Party did you vote for in the 1980 General Election] --> Pol80Var[Party voted for in 1980]
  end
```

#### Lifecycle evolution of a variable
```mermaid
graph RL
  Pol90Var[Party voted for in 1990] -- BasedOn -->  Pol80Var[Party voted for in 1980] -- BasedOn -->  Pol78Var[Party voted for in 1978]
```

### Variable Cascade
This is a hierachy of
- A conceptual variable
- Represented variables
- Instance variable

```mermaid
graph TB
  PolConcept[Political Party Affiliation] --> PolRep1 --> Pol90Var[Party voted for in 1990]
  PolConcept[Political Party Affiliation] --> PolRep2 --> Pol80Var[Party voted for in 1980]
  PolConcept[Political Party Affiliation] --> PolRep2 --> Pol78Var[Party voted for in 1978]
```

The variable cascade does not require all three to be specified.
- A conceptual variable
- Instance variables
```mermaid
graph TB
  PolConcept[Political Party Affiliation] --> Pol90Var[Party voted for in 1990]
  PolConcept[Political Party Affiliation] --> Pol80Var[Party voted for in 1980]
  PolConcept[Political Party Affiliation] --> Pol78Var[Party voted for in 1978]
```

If question information is available these relationships can also be expresed
```mermaid
graph TB
  PolConcept[Political Party Affiliation] --> Pol90Var[Party voted for in 1990]
  PolConcept[Political Party Affiliation] --> Pol80Var[Party voted for in 1980]
  PolConcept[Political Party Affiliation] --> Pol78Var[Party voted for in 1978]
  Pol90Var[Party voted for in 1990] --> Pol90[Which Party did you vote for in the 1990 General Election]
  Pol80Var[Party voted for in 1980] --> Pol80[Which Party did you vote for in the 1980 General Election]
  Pol78Var[Party voted for in 1978] --> Pol78[Which Party did you vote for in the 1978 General Election]
```

If same question ithese relationships can also be expresed
```mermaid
graph TB
  PolConcept[Political Party Affiliation] --> Pol90Var[Party voted for in 1990]
  PolConcept[Political Party Affiliation] --> Pol80Var[Party voted for in 1980]
  PolConcept[Political Party Affiliation] --> Pol78Var[Party voted for in 1978]
  Pol90Var[Party voted for in 1990] --> Pol[Which Party did you vote for in the last General Election]
  Pol80Var[Party voted for in 1980] --> Pol[Which Party did you vote for in the last General Election]
  Pol78Var[Party voted for in 1978] --> Pol[Which Party did you vote for in the last General Election]
```
